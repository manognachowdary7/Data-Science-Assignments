Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.\n",

Camera quality is just superb, pics from 13 pro max looks more real as compare to other premium segments which are using more AI and color combinations. Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days.  Very smooth and fast performance. Just go for it.\n",

Luckily due to the high demand for iPhone 14 pro, I could sell at the same price. Then I purchased 13 pro max. It has been 1 week and I found battery backup is very good. No doubt about other features of the iPhone.\n",

       "    Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.\n",

So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand. It works great for me and has a longer battery life than the previous phones that I've had.\n",

       "    I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.\n",

Camera quality is just superb, pics from 13 pro max looks more real as compare to other premium segments which are using more AI and color combinations. Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days.  Very smooth and fast performance. Just go for it.\n",

Luckily due to the high demand for iPhone 14 pro, I could sell at the same price. Then I purchased 13 pro max. It has been 1 week and I found battery backup is very good.

       "    Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.\n",

So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand. It works great for me and has a longer battery life than the previous phones that I've had.\n",

       "    I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.\n",

Camera quality is just superb, pics from 13 pro max looks more real as compare to other premium segments which are using more AI and color combinations. Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days.  Very smooth and fast performance. Just go for it.\n",

Luckily due to the high demand for iPhone 14 pro, I could sell at the same price. Then I purchased 13 pro max. It has been 1 week and I found battery backup is very good. No doubt about other features of the iPhone.\n",

       "    Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.\n",

So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand. It works great for me and has a longer battery life than the previous phones that I've had.\n",

Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.\\n  \\n                                          \n",

Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days.  Very smooth and fast performance.

No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.\\n  \\n\n",

Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it. \"                                          \n",

No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android. \"\n",

Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.                                           </td></tr>\n",

Then I sell this phone to the store. Luckily due to the high demand for iPhone 14 pro, I could sell at the same price. Then I purchased 13 pro max. It has been 1 week and I found battery backup is very good.

Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android. </td></tr>\n",

So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand.

Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.                                           \\\\\n",

Look -- Very good looking phone and feel premium when you hold it.A refresh rate of 120Hz is good to feel on 13 pro max. Camera quality is just superb, pics from 13 pro max looks more real as compare to other premium segments which are using more AI and color combinations. Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days. Very smooth and fast performance. Just go for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\\\\n",

Then I sell this phone to the store. Luckily due to the high demand for iPhone 14 pro, I could sell at the same price. Then I purchased 13 pro max. It has been 1 week and I found battery backup is very good. No doubt about other features of the iPhone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android. \\\\\n",

So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand.

Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.                                            |\n",

Look -- Very good looking phone and feel premium when you hold it.A refresh rate of 120Hz is good to feel on 13 pro max. Camera quality is just superb, pics from 13 pro max looks more real as compare to other premium segments which are using more AI and color combinations. Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days. Very smooth and fast performance. Just go for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

Then I sell this phone to the store. Luckily due to the high demand for iPhone 14 pro, I could sell at the same price. Then I purchased 13 pro max. It has been 1 week and I found battery backup is very good. No doubt about other features of the iPhone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.  |\n",

So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand.

       "2   I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.                                           \n",
       "3   1st thing 1st... Look -- Very good looking phone and feel premium when you hold it.A refresh rate of 120Hz is good to feel on 13 pro max. Camera quality is just superb, pics from 13 pro max looks more real as compare to other premium segments which are using more AI and color combinations. Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days. Very smooth and fast performance.

       "4   I first purchased iPhone 14 pro then I realized that it drains the battery quickly(Don't have any idea about 14 pro max). Then I sell this phone to the store. Luckily due to the high demand for iPhone 14 pro, I could sell at the same price. Then I purchased 13 pro max. It has been 1 week and I found battery backup is very good.

       "5   Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android. \n",

No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.                    </td><td>4.0 out of 5 stars  Switched from Android to iPhone.

Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.                     & 4.0 out of 5 stars  Switched from Android to iPhone.

No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.                     | 4.0 out of 5 stars  Switched from Android to iPhone.

       "2   I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.                                           \n",

       "5   Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android. \n",

No doubt about other features of the iPhone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "5  4.0 out of 5 stars  Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android. \n",
       "6  5.0 out of 5 stars  The best smartphone i have ever used. Great battery life. 12 hours of screen on time. Need to charge once in two days only even with heavy usage. Charging is fast with 30 watt apple charger. Best camera quality. Speakers are excellent. Face unlock is best.Perfect sync with ipad through icloud.This is my first apple phone and i am never going back to android.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "7  5.0 out of 5 stars  I was very skeptical about the genuineness of the product that I would receive as it was not available in stock in stores. So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand. It works great for me and has a longer battery life than the previous phones that I've had.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

Look -- Very good looking phone and feel premium when you hold it.A refresh rate of 120Hz is good to feel on 13 pro max. Camera quality is just superb, pics from 13 pro max looks more real as compare to other premium segments which are using more AI and color combinations. Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days. Very smooth and fast performance. Just go for it. \n",

Then I sell this phone to the store. Luckily due to the high demand for iPhone 14 pro, I could sell at the same price. Then I purchased 13 pro max. It has been 1 week and I found battery backup is very good. No doubt about other features of the iPhone. \n",
      "5   Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android. \n",

Great battery life. 12 hours of screen on time. Need to charge once in two days only even with heavy usage. Charging is fast with 30 watt apple charger. Best camera quality. Speakers are excellent. Face unlock is best.Perfect sync with ipad through icloud.This is my first apple phone and i am never going back to android. \n",

So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand. It works great for me and has a longer battery life than the previous phones that I've had. \n",

Look -- Very good looking phone and feel premium when you hold it.A refresh rate of 120Hz is good to feel on 13 pro max. Camera quality is just superb, pics from 13 pro max looks more real as compare to other premium segments which are using more AI and color combinations. Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days. Very smooth and fast performance. Just go for it. \n",

Then I sell this phone to the store. Luckily due to the high demand for iPhone 14 pro, I could sell at the same price. Then I purchased 13 pro max. It has been 1 week and I found battery backup is very good. No doubt about other features of the iPhone. \n",
      "5  4.0 out of 5 stars  Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android. \n",

Great battery life. 12 hours of screen on time. Need to charge once in two days only even with heavy usage. Charging is fast with 30 watt apple charger. Best camera quality. Speakers are excellent. Face unlock is best.Perfect sync with ipad through icloud.This is my first apple phone and i am never going back to android. \n",

So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand. It works great for me and has a longer battery life than the previous phones that I've had. \n",

Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.                    </td><td>4.0 out of 5 stars  Switched from Android to iPhone.

Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.                     & 4.0 out of 5 stars  Switched from Android to iPhone.

Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.                     | 4.0 out of 5 stars  Switched from Android to iPhone.

       "2   I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.                                           \n",
       "3   1st thing 1st... Look -- Very good looking phone and feel premium when you hold it.A refresh rate of 120Hz is good to feel on 13 pro max.

       "5   Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android. \n",

Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.                                           \n",

The charging could be faster and Touch ID would be nice, but overall this is a beast that can’t be beat.Pros+Best cameras in a phone+Superior performance+Cinematic video mode+Brighter display+Excellent battery lifeCons-Could use faster charging-Cinematic mode capped at 1080p                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
